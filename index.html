        BMW 4 Series Coupé M Models. Equipped with the high-performance 510 hp
        BMW M TwinPower Turbo inline 6-cylinder petrol engine and various

      <p>
        The BMW M4 CS was photographed without any camouflage while it was in a
        commercial shoot about two months ago. Now we know the vehicle in all
        its details. As predicted, the CS, nestled between the Competition
        Package-equipped M4 and the track-focused M4 GTS, will be the new
        flagship of the 4 Series range, as the fiercest M4 variant is no longer
        available. BMW underlined that the "CS" suffix is ​​now permanent and
        will represent the versions that will be placed on the models with the
        Competition Package mentioned above.

      <h2>Prices</h2>
      <p>
        The new M4 CS has seen some updates in weight as well as increased
        power. The use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) in many places,
        including the roof, saves 6 kg, while the hood is 25% lighter than in
        the M4. The fiery coupe has lost 32 kg in total as a result of his diet.
        Weight reduction efforts continue in the cabin. Using compact natural
        fibers in the rear section, the German manufacturer has made the M4 CS
        both minimalist and lightweight by reducing the climate control unit to
        a single stage. BMW engineers also updated the suspension system by
        overhauling the vehicle's shock absorber and spring settings. The new
        front splitter and rear diffuser in the M4 version, with light alloy
        wheels measuring 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear,
        optimize the airflow passing under the vehicle. Thanks to all these
        updates, the BMW M4 CS managed to lap the Nürburgring in 7 minutes and
        38 seconds. That makes it about 10 seconds slower than the M4 GTS. On
        the other hand, this rating is a full 14 seconds faster than the
        standard M4 with DCT transmission. BMW is asking €116,900 for the new M4
        CS in Germany (about € 459,041 at today's rates) and £89,130 ​​(about €
        419,020) in the United Kingdom. The Bavarian brand will start sales of
        the performance model before the second half of 2018.
